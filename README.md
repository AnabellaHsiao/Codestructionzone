### Project title and team name

Team Name: Dark Web Illuminati

Project Title: Codestruction Zone

### Our focus

We will be front-end focused: making a 3D platform for children to learn basic coding(Java) with fun games. There would be single,or duo-player(versus and teamwork) options.

Single: the user solves the code by theirselves

Duo: for compete option. We give the two mini users the same puzzle and whoever gets it first wins(3 rounds in total)
     for teamwork option, Given a harder code puzzle, the 2 mini users need to learn how to cooperate with each other and solve the question together
     We motivate the mini users with accomplishment badges and
     
threejs: for 3D platform production
Reactflow: for basic frontend designs
